# City Explorer

**Contributors**: Milo Anderson, Jasmin Arensdorf, Jessica Roland

## Overview
This is a backend server app that retreives information about a city. It returns map data, weather forecasts, nearby restaurants, meetups, trails, and movies set in the given city.

## Getting Started
After you clone the repo, you will need to run 'npm i' in your console to install the dependencies. You will also need to create an .env file and add a PORT number and your own API keys, e.g.:

PORT=3000
GEOCODE_API_KEY=[api_key]
WEATHER_API_KEY=[api_key]
YELP_API_KEY=[api_key]
MOVIE_API_KEY=[api_key]

## Architecture
This app depends on express, cors, superagent, and dotenv. It reads incoming query parameters and uses a superagent 'get()' call to return data from various APIs, which is then parsed into an object and returned to the client.
